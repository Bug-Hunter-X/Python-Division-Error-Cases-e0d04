This repository demonstrates a subtle and uncommon TypeError that can occur in Python when performing division.  The `bug.py` file contains a function that includes a ZeroDivisionError check but fails silently when presented with non-numeric input for division. The solution avoids this by performing explicit type checking before the division operation.  This example highlights the importance of robust input validation in Python.
